## üé® Code Style & Standards

### General Principles

- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Clarity**: Write self-documenting code with clear names
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI changes are accessible

### TypeScript Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear interfaces and type definitions
interface GameSequence {
  position: number
  audio: number
  timestamp: number
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive function names and parameters
const calculateAccuracy = (
  correct: number, 
  incorrect: number, 
  missed: number = 0
): number => {
  const total = correct + incorrect + missed
  return total > 0 ? (correct / total) * 100 : 0
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good: Functional components with hooks
const GameBoard: React.FC = () => {
  const { gamePhase, score } = useGameStore()
  
  // Memoize expensive calculations
  const accuracy = useMemo(() => 
    calculateAccuracy(score.totalCorrect, score.totalIncorrect, score.totalMissed),
    [score]
  )
  
  return (
    <Paper elevation={2}>
      <Typography variant="h4">
        Score: {accuracy.toFixed(1)}%
      </Typography>
    </Paper>
  )
}
```

### State Management Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear action names and immutable updates
export const useGameStore = create<GameStore>((set, get) => ({
  score: initialScore,
  
  updateScore: (newScore) => set((state) => ({
    score: { ...state.score, ...newScore }
  })),
  
  resetGame: () => set({ 
    score: initialScore,
    gamePhase: 'waiting' 
  })
}))
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Testing Philosophy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Manual Testing**: Verify user experience and accessibility

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear test descriptions and scenarios
describe('calculateAccuracy', () => {
  it('should return 100% for all correct responses', () => {
    expect(calculateAccuracy(10, 0, 0)).toBe(100)
  })
  
  it('should include missed opportunities as failures', () => {
    expect(calculateAccuracy(9, 0, 6)).toBe(60)
  })
  
  it('should handle edge case of no responses', () => {
    expect(calculateAccuracy(0, 0, 0)).toBe(0)
  })
})
```
